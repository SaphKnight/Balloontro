# Balloontro
A BalloonSMP inspired mod

Balatro is made by LocalThunk and published by Playstack

BalloonSMP is a Minecraft SMP hosted by SocksBX and features many great streamers and friends. Jokers featured in this mod depict real people (albeit roleplaying).

I do not claim ownership of BalloonSMP or Balatro. I just made a silly fun mod.

This mod requires Lovely and Steammodded to run.

Joker art is made by greenkibble, code is written by me.

README is still a WIP I do not know what to include in these things lol
